# Learning Meteor.js

This is my first stab at learning Meteor.js. I'm following Discover Starter Edition for now to evaluate how the framework works for a designer like me. So far, I'm following along just fine. The book is really well written.

# Discover Meteor

In order to run Meteor locally follow these instructions below:

### Install Meteor

```html
curl https://install.meteor.com | sh
```

### Creating a Simple App

```html
meteor create microscope
```

### Adding a Package

```html

```

### Run Meteor Locally

```html
meteor
```

### Common commands

`meteor reset` The reset completely clears out Mongo Database.
